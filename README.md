## illumos-aarch64

wip for some illumos-aarch64 bits.

## disassembler

* dis\_aarch64.c - copy to usr/src/lib/libdisasm/common/dis\_aarch64.c
* tests/ - copy into usr/src/test/util-tests/tests/dis/aarch64/
* usr\_src.diff - apply to usr/src

Sorry, the `usr_src.diff` has a bunch of stuff not relevant for the disasm,
I'll try to clean it up at some point.
